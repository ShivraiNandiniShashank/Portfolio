  <p>Dear Visitor,</p>

  <p>Welcome to my portfolio webpage, a space where creativity, skill, and passion converge. I am thrilled to present to you a curated collection of my work, showcasing my expertise, accomplishments, and dedication as a Design Engineer in various fields, including industrial design, prototyping, and PPAP (Production Part Approval Process).</p>

  <p>As an experienced Design Engineer, I have had the opportunity to work with renowned organizations, contributing to the development of cutting-edge solutions. Currently, I am proudly associated with Kazam EVTech in Bangalore, where I have been since May 2023. In this role, I have been instrumental in designing innovative solutions for the electric vehicle (EV) industry. My contributions span the realms of Product Design, EV Technology and EV Charging infrastructure, where I have worked on projects involving Charging Stations and their integration into the overall EV ecosystem.</p>

  <p>My experience also includes working as a Design Engineer at Godbole Gates Pvt. Ltd., specializing in the design and optimization of Irrigation Gates. Through my role, I have gained expertise in utilizing various software tools such as Fusion360, ALibre, Creo, OnShape, and SolidWorks to bring concepts to life, ensuring seamless integration of design and functionality. Core Mechanical and Industrial processes of manufacturing standards, IS standards, material selection, Bill of Quantities, QAQC, Installation processes were handled during this tenure.</p>

  <p>Furthermore, my journey as a Development Engineer at Shiwalkar Vantech Pvt. Ltd. equipped me with the skills to create innovative solutions for diverse industries. This role involved utilizing my expertise in prototyping and employing advanced design tools to optimize products for performance and manufacturability.</p>

  <p>During my career, I have also had the privilege of serving as a TIFAC intern at Minar Hydro System Pvt. Ltd

., where I actively participated in projects related to RnD of Hydraulic Torque Wrench. This experience provided me with valuable hands-on experience in the field and further enhanced my passion for creating impactful designs which finally resulted in a design patent in my name at al.</p>

  <p>To complement my practical experience, I continuously seek to expand my knowledge and stay at the forefront of emerging trends and technologies. I am proficient in utilizing software such as Fusion360, ALibre, Creo, OnShape, and SolidWorks and rendering software like KeyShot to create innovative designs that meet and exceed client expectations.</p>

  <p>Thank you for taking the time to explore my portfolio webpage. I hope it provides you with valuable insights into my skills, expertise, and work philosophy. Should you have any inquiries, collaborative opportunities, or simply wish to connect, please do not hesitate to reach out.</p>

  <div class="work">
  <h3>Project 1</h3>
  <div class="project-details">
    <div class="project-text">
      <p>Hinganghat Pumphouse Project</p>
      <p>The project was done under guidance of Mr Prashant Godbole, Director of Godbole Gates Pvt. Ltd. himself.</p>
      <p>Godbole Type Semi-Automatic Radial Gates were proposed at the Hinganghat Pump House on river Veena in Vidarbha Region of Maharashtra.</p>
      <p>The river bed being soft, this project has the potential of setting a benchmark in the Irrigation Sector.</p>
      <p>The gate leaf, its hoisting arrangement, structural stability of the mechanical components, material selection as per IS standards, simulation of the entire assembly including civil structures in Alibre, generating 2D drawings, and developing detailed manufacturing drawings for fabrication were done by me in this project.</p>
      <p>I also was the official channel of communication between GGPL and Government Officials of the Irrigation Department for all project-related documents.</p>
